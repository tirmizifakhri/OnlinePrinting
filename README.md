PROPOSAL FOR PROJECT DEVELOPMENT
--------------------------------

1.1 INTRODUCTION

Our project is on online printing mobile app where IIUM community can order their printing needs using the app directly.


1.2 PROBLEM DESCRIPTION

    1.2.1 Background of the problem
    -------------------------------    
    Environment for the application is mobile application. Our target user is IIUM community which consist of Staff and 
    Students since they have their own ID(Matric number & staff ID). Currently the printing shop can accept online printing order but it is unorganized.
    There are too many platforms that the customer use to send the files that cause the shop's staff sometimes missed out some orders.
    The platforms that we recieve orders from the customer are Whatsapp, Email and USB drive to print out at the shop. Therefore, by creating a
    mobile application as a medium to recieve order from the customer, we hope that it will ease our work and organize the order soo that we will not miss any order
    from the customer.
    
    
    
    1.2.2 Problem Statement
    -----------------------
    - Manual printing services in IIUM need to be upgraded with online printing service where it solve problem for those who do not want to queue in front of printing 
      shop to print their assignments or any documents.
    - Printing shop in IIUM did not operate 24 hours a day, thus it cannot help student that need urgent printing services.
    - Some of the students sometimes didnt have much time to queu and print their assignments or any documents. 

1.3 PROJECT OBJECTIVE

To make a mobile application where it can simplify the process of customers ordering online for their printing items.
There will be a login part to identify that the user is from IIUM. A page where user can choose their print settings and
an upload files field to send the files that they want to print directly to the shop. After that, user will be navigated 
to payment gateway in order for them to pay first to proceed with their order. This is to secure transaction between
the shop and the users in case the shop have printed their items but the customer never comes to pick it up. 
Hence, there will be a status order to notify the user on when they can pick up their item. 


1.4 PROJECT SCOPE

    1.4.1 Scope
    -----------
    The scope is for printing normal documents like assignments and notes. The printing can be choose either in black and white or in colour.  

    1.4.2 Targeted User
    -------------------
    This application only can be used for IIUM community where their identification is determined by their email and matric number.

    1.4.3 Specific Platform
    -----------------------
    Discuss the infrastructure that you need for the development and execution of the
    application (software, hardware, network, etc.) Indicate if there is any specific
    requirement that the Kulliyyah does not have and inform the audience how are you
    planning to handle that limitation. What are your other solutions to fulfill the
    requirement of the project?


1.5 CONSTRAINTS

Constraints that may occur is time and budget since the application we wanted to develop 
is given about 3 weeks to complete and we as students do not have budget to use more sophiscticated
software.

Task 1: Plan the flow of the application -> Due: 27-11-2018

Task 3: -> Due: 
Task 4: -> Due: 


1.7 SIGNIFICANCE OF THE PROJECT

With this application, customers can save their time when they want to print their items and avoid queueing at the shop. The customers espesially the students sometimes 
finish their assignments and projects in the night and they cannot print their works because there is no printing shop available 24 hours, soo they need to wait in the 
morning to print it. By using this application, they can just send their documents through the application and pick it up the next day or during their free time. This 
application will also ease the printing staff works as they receive order in an organize way therefore avoid them from overlooked any unprint documents.
