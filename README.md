PROPOSAL FOR PROJECT DEVELOPMENT
--------------------------------

1.1 INTRODUCTION

Our project is on online printing mobile app where IIUM community can order their printing needs using the app directly.


1.2 PROBLEM DESCRIPTION

    1.2.1 Background of the problem
    -------------------------------    
    Environment for the application is mobile application. Our target user is IIUM community which consist of Staff and 
    Students since they have their own ID. Currently the printing shop can accept online printing order but is unorganized.
    There are too many platforms that customer can send the files to until the shop staff sometimes missed out some orders.
    Current platforms use are Whatsapp, Email and USB to print out at the shop. 
    
    
    1.2.2 Problem Statement
    -----------------------
    Currently people are stil queueing up at the shop and need to wait for their turn to use the computer and print their 
    needs. It is troublesome for the customers and also the staff in charge since they need to prepare the order quickly at
    the same time hectic when there are errors in the print output. For online ordering, currently the shop uses Email and
    Whatsapp as a platform. Since there are more than one platforms, staff in charge may missed out 1 or 2 orders because.
    It is also ambigious to direct each new customers on how is the flow of the online ordering.


1.3 PROJECT OBJECTIVE

To make a mobile application where it can simplify the process of customers ordering online for their printing items.
There will be a login part to identify that the user is from IIUM. A page where user can choose their print settings and
an upload files field to send the files that they want to print directly to the shop. After that, user will be navigated 
to payment gateway in order for them to pay first to proceed with their order. This is to secure transaction between
the shop and the users in case the shop have printed their items but the customer never comes to pick it up. 
Hence, there will be a status order to notify the user on when they can pick up their item.
